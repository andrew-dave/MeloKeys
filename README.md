# Melokeys: 
This is a short-term project in C to explore the multi-core computation of the parallax propeller platform. An interactive music system was developed to enable music recording note-wise and performing playback. This helps users learn the basics of music through keynotes. This would be perfect for those new to music or seeking a fun hobby. 

The visual representation of notes key-wise and note-wise helps them learn in a better manner. Users interact with the system via push buttons designed as keys, where each key corresponds to a musical note stored in memory. The LEDs under each key, provide visual feedback when pressing a key which enables visual learning. Additionally, a record feature allows users to record, allowing users to capture record, and play for instructed learning.

# Using multiple cores:
 The COGs or COREs within the platform is used for the recording the playback functionality.

A couple of zero PCBs were used to develop a modular circuit that can directly be installed upon the I/O pins of the propeller platform.
